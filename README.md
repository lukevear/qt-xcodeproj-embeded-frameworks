# A small python script to help embed frameworks in xcodeproj files created with qmake

This python script will allow you to embed `.framework` files into your XCode project files generated by qmake. This script uses the amazing [kronenthaler/mod-pbxproj](https://github.com/kronenthaler/mod-pbxproj) under the hood.

## Getting Started
Simply add a 'Custom Process Step' after the qmake build build task in your project settings. As we're a python script, set the 'command' to `/usr/local/bin/python`. You then need to add the following arguments:

- The full path to the generated `.xcodeproj` (_project_)
- A list of frameworks (with their full path and a space between each) to embed (_frameworks_)

For example, if your project was called "TestProject", you cloned this repository into the root project folder and wanted to embed "FrameworkA" and "FrameworkB" (which were under a folder called 'lib'), you'd enter:

```
%{sourceDir}/qt-xcodeproj-embeded-frameworks/embed.py %{buildDir}/TestProject.xcodeproj %{sourceDir}/lib/FrameworkA.framework %{sourceDir}/lib/FrameworkB.framework
```
